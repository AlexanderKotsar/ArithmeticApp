I have used Java and Android structures to create an interactive arithmetic game in which the user tries to answer as many questions correctly in a row as possible. I implemented multiple levels and arithmetic question types with operators and operands tailored to the game logic. The app saves high scores and state data automatically, with common app elements including a High Scores display and helpful information about the game
